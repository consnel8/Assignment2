## Project Information
In this assignment we are creating our own web chat server from a Java web application. Our chat server has multiple chat rooms so you will be able to talk to new people depending on what room you are in. When you join a server a prompt will show up telling you what room you just joined. Also when you join a server you automatically leave the previous server, so you will not be able to be in multiple servers at the same time. 

## Improvments
The Improvements that we have made are
